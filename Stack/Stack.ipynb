    "### What is Stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack is an abstract data type with a bounded(predefined) capacity. It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order. Every time an element is added, it goes on the top of the stack and the only element that can be removed is the element that is at the top of the stack, just like a pile of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature feature makes it **LIFO** data structure. LIFO stands for **Last-in-first-out.** Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first. In stack terminology, **insertion operation** is called **PUSH** operation and **removal operation** is called **POP** operation."
